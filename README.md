# Splithowdy

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.3.

## Purpose

This project is meant to showcase an Angular Library whose components are split into separate JavaScript bundles during build time. We are using the Angular CLI's ng-packagr to create our bundles. Through the use of independent `package.json` files in each of the component modules, we are able to indicate to the packager which modules need code splitting.
