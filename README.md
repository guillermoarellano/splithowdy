### Tutorial: Code Splitting Angular UI Library using CLI v9

In [this code showcase](https://github.com/guillermoarellano/splithowdy/tree/code-split-library), an Angular Library's components are split into separate JavaScript bundles during build time. We use the Angular CLI's ng-packagr to create our bundles. Through the use of independent `package.json` files in each of the component modules, we are able to indicate to the packager which modules need code splitting.
